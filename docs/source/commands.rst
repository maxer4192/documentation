Commands
========

Below is a comprehensive listing of every command currently in the bot, the arguments the command expects, and the permissions you will need to be able to use the command.

?ban
----

As probably guessed, this command bans a member from the server it is executed in. You must have a role that has either the ``Ban Members`` or ``Administrator`` permission enabled.

Usage:

``?ban <Mention the user or provide and ID> <Reason, if applicable>``

This command expects the bot to have the ability to ban members, or is a server administrator.


?purge
------
