===================================

You've reached the official documentation for the ReapeR Discord bot. On this website you will find information on every command, as well as certain other information that may pertain to current or future bot components.

.. note::

   These docs imply you have already invited the bot to your server, and it has the necessary permissions to do the actions outlined by each command, or, is an Administrator.
